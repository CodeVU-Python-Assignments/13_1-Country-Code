# Exercise 1: 
Print out the two-character country code from the retrieved data. 
Add error checking so your program does not traceback if the country code is not there. 
Once you have it working, search for “Atlantic Ocean” and make sure it can
handle locations that are not in any country.

You may do this using JSON or XML and I have Included the JSON and XML examples to get you started.

The original examples were infinite loops, write your function to run only once.

# Example
```
Enter location: Kansas City, MO
Country Code: US
```

```
Enter location: Brazil
Country Code: BR
```

```
Enter location: Atlantic Ocean
"No country code found."
```
